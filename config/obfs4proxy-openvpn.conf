### obfs4 transport settings ###################
#
# * Higher IAT_MODE, makes obfs4proxy more resistant to
#   time-based dpi fingerprinting. However, It makes the
#   connection considerably slower. This setting can be
#   adjusted for server and client independently and doesn't
#   need to be the same for both of them.
#   acceptable modes are: 0, 1, 2

IAT_MODE			0

### General client mode settings ###############
#
# * CLIENT_UPSTREAM_PROXY is needed if your client is
#   behind a proxy server

### obfs4 transport in client mode settings ####
#
# ** Either CERT or (NODE_ID && PUBLIC_KEY) should be specified.
#
# * On obfs4proxy-openvpn-linux, You can extract the CERT from
#   the obfs4proxy server by using:
#   'obfs4proxy-openvpn --export-cert -'
#
# * On obfs4proxy-openvpn-windows when run in server mode,
#   by default the CERT is located in:
#   "date\obfs4\cert.txt"

### General server mode settings ###############
#
# * SERVER_OBFS4_BIND_ADDR and SERVER_OBFS4_BIND_PORT, are the ones
#   that should also be set as 'remote' parameters for clients in
#   openvpn_client.conf file (obviously if you set SERVER_OBFS4_BIND_ADDR
#   to 0.0.0.0, then you need to provide the real public server IP address
#   in your openvpn clients 'remote' parameter, not 0.0.0.0).
#
# * Don't forget to open up SERVER_OBFS4_BIND_PORT port for incoming traffic
#   on your server firewall.
#
# * You likely don't need to change SERVER_OPENVPN_BIND_ADDR and
#   SERVER_OPENVPN_BIND_PORT, but it can potentially be used to
#   provide both obfuscated and non-obfuscated openvpn traffic
#   at the same time (when SERVER_OPENVPN_BIND_ADDR is set to 0.0.0.0)

SERVER_OBFS4_BIND_ADDR		0.0.0.0
SERVER_OBFS4_BIND_PORT		1516
SERVER_OPENVPN_BIND_ADDR	127.0.0.1
SERVER_OPENVPN_BIND_PORT	1515

### OpenVPN config settings ####################
#
# ** You likely don't need to change any of these settings
#
# * Adjusting OPENVPN_BINARY and OPENVPN_GUI_BINARY is only required
#   if you have installed OpenVPN in a non-default location.
#
# * OPENVPN_RELATIVE_PATH makes all OpenVPN paths (including those
#   specified in openvpn conf files), relative. Note that %SCRIPT_ROOT%
#   is a special variable always pointing to the root directory of the
#   script).
#
# * By default, OPENVPN_CONFIG_FILE (which is a relative path), is
#   automatically adjusted based on the MODE (client/server).
#
# * If OPENVPN_GUI_HOOK is set to true, the script will try to
#   take advantage of the built-in OpenVPN GUI functionality to run
#   OpenVPN. Otherwise, OpenVPN will be directly run in cmd mode
#   by the script. Please note that using OPENVPN_GUI_HOOK has the
#   advantage of running the script as a normal user and still
#   allowing OpenVPN to do some privilege tasks (e.g., setting
#   up routes)
